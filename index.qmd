## Introduction

TGs (Technical Guidelines) are documents that provide technical guidance on specific tasks or methods relevant to the work of IPBES (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services). They are intended to support the implementation of IPBES assessments and other deliverables by providing practical advice and best practices.

These guidelines are developed by the tsu (IPBES Data and Knowledge Technical Support Unit) together with the associated tf (Task Force on Knowledge and Data) and approved by the MEP (Multidisciplinary Expert Panel) and the Bureau.

Not all TGS are relevant to all IPBES experts. TO make it easier to identify the relevant TGs, each TG is tagged with one or more of the following tags:

- ![Assesment Tsu](figures/icon-assesment_tsu.svg){height=20} **assesment_tsu**: Relevant for the assessment tsus
- ![Assessment Experts](figures/icon-assesment_experts.svg){height=20} **assesment_experts**: Relevant for the assessment experts
- ![Expert](figures/icon-expert.svg){height=20} **expert**: Relevant for the TF and other IPBES experts
- ![TSUs](figures/icon-tsu.svg){height=20} **tsu**: Relevant for the IPBES tsus apart from the assessment tsus
- ![Secretariat](figures/icon-secretariat.svg){height=20} **secretariat**: Relevant for the IPBES secretariat

Each individual TG is available as a html as well as pdf and is deposited including the source file and all required additional files on Zenodo and consequently has a DOI. At the end of each TG a suggested citation can be found.

Each TG is versioned and the version number is indicated in the document. If a TG is updated, the new version will be made available on Zenodo with a new DOI. The previous versions will remain accessible for reference.

The following Icons are used to indicate the relevant target groups for each TG:

- [TG 1 Title](TG.html) â€” DOI: [![DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.11389482](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.11389482.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11389482) ![expert](figures/icon-expert.svg){height=15} ![tsu](figures/icon-tsu.svg){height=15} ![secretariat](figures/icon-secretariat.svg){height=15} ![assesment_tsu](figures/icon-assesment_tsu.svg){height=15} ![assesment_experts](figures/icon-assesment_experts.svg){height=15}
  The TG addresses the recurring question of if one can add animated comic strips in the assessments. It provides practical guidance on how to do so in a scientifically sound manner.

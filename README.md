## Introduction

TGs (Technical Guidelines) are documents that provide technical guidance
on specific tasks or methods relevant to the work of IPBES
(Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem
Services). They are intended to support the implementation of IPBES
assessments and other deliverables by providing practical advice and
best practices.

These guidelines are developed by the tsu (IPBES Data and Knowledge
Technical Support Unit) together with the associated tf (Task Force on
Knowledge and Data) and approved by the MEP (Multidisciplinary Expert
Panel) and the Bureau.

Not all TGS are relevant to all IPBES experts. TO make it easier to
identify the relevant TGs, each TG is tagged with one or more of the
following tags:

- <img src="figures/icon-assesment_tsu.svg" height="20"
  alt="Assesment Tsu" /> **assesment_tsu**: Relevant for the assessment
  tsus
- <img src="figures/icon-assesment_experts.svg" height="20"
  alt="Assessment Experts" /> **assesment_experts**: Relevant for the
  assessment experts
- <img src="figures/icon-expert.svg" height="20" alt="Expert" />
  **expert**: Relevant for the TF and other IPBES experts
- <img src="figures/icon-tsu.svg" height="20" alt="TSUs" /> **tsu**:
  Relevant for the IPBES tsus apart from the assessment tsus
- <img src="figures/icon-secretariat.svg" height="20" alt="Secretariat" />
  **secretariat**: Relevant for the IPBES secretariat

Each individual TG is available as a html as well as pdf and is
deposited including the source file and all required additional files on
Zenodo and consequently has a DOI. At the end of each TG a suggested
citation can be found.

Each TG is versioned and the version number is indicated in the
document. If a TG is updated, the new version will be made available on
Zenodo with a new DOI. The previous versions will remain accessible for
reference.

The following Icons are used to indicate the relevant target groups for
each TG:

  if one can add animated comic strips in the assessments. It provides
  practical guidance on how to do so in a scientifically sound manner.
